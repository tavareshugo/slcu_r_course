Today we will spend more time solving practical problems, trying to apply the
concepts and principles that we have learned in modules01-03:

- performing sanity checks;
- manipulating data with ``dplyr``;
- building custom visualiztions with ``ggplot``;


# Set up the environment
# Download the data ----

# Check that dataset does not contain obvious problems ---

# Data transforms ----

# Build plots ----
