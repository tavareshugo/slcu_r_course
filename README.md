# slcu_r_course

## Pre-requisites

* Install R and Rstudio (we can help if they didn't manage)
* Bring your own data (optional)

## Module 1 - data and file organisation

File organisation (30 min total):

* Tips and don'ts for file naming
* Briefly about directory structure (but we then apply this in the R sessions)

Data organisation in spreadsheets (30 min total):

* Use the stats-intro material but in the exercise people write down problems and solutions instead of actually fixing the table (takes too long).
* Also can bring their own spreadsheets if they want to tidy

End session with reading their data (or an example) into R - links to next session.

## Module 2 - ggplot in R

Will do this with Rmarkdown.

* Need to find example dataset (maybe something published?)
    * Couple of measured stuff
    * A few factor variables

* Read the data in
* Sanity check data import
    * Introduce `dim`, `summary`, `visdat`
* Help!
* Plotting! Introducing ggplot logic
    * Scatter
    * Boxplots/Violin (try and do that in Excel!)
    * Histogram/Density (try excel!!!)
    * Faceting, colouring (show colour-blind palette), groups
    * Heatmap
    * Annotation (`geom_text` and `annotate`)
    * Joyplots?
    * Can configure everything with `theme()`. `theme_bw()`, etc...
* `ggplotly`!!

## Module - advanced data manipulation (dplyr)

* Filtering (need to introduce logical vectors and conditional operators)
* Group-by-summarise
* Factors (re-order variables in graphs, for example)


## Module - bring your own

## Module - basic stats (t.test, anova, lm)
