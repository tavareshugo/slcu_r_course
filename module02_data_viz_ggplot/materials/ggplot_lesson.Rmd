# [SLCU R Course](https://tavareshugo.github.io/slcu_r_course/)

## Data Visualization with R

In this lesson we will learn how to explore tabular data, perform basic sanity 
checks and do visualizations with [``ggplot2``](http://ggplot2.org/).


## Setting things up

In this lesson we are going to use some R packages containing functions we need:

- `tidyverse` which contains a collection of several packages for data manipulation 
and visualization (including the `ggplot2` package)
- `visdat` to give you a quick and visual representation of your data
- `plotly` to produce interactive graphics

You can install packages by using the ``install.packages()`` function. 
For example, if you wanted to install the `plotly` package you would 
do:

``` r
install.packages("plotly")
```

Once the packages are installed, we can load them in the current R session 
with the ``library()`` function: 

```{r load packages, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(visdat)
library(plotly)
```

You should also set your working directory to the folder containing this 
lesson's materials. This will vary depending on your operating system. 

``` r
setwd("~/Desktop/slcu_r_course/module02_data_viz_ggplot/materials")
```

In this example, our working directory was set to the 
`module02_data_viz_ggplot/materials` folder.

Now our workspace is ready. 
The only thing missing is the actual data set that we want to explore and visualize! 

For this lesson we will use a slightly simplified version of a dataset published 
by [Burghard et al 2015](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.65d76). 


## Read the data

The simplified version of the data set can be found in the ``module02_data_viz_ggplot/data`` 
folder (`burghardt_et_al_2015_expt1.csv`). 

Because our working directory is in `module02_data_viz_ggplot/materials` folder, 
we read the data like so:

```{r read data}
# Read data and store it in expt1 object
expt1 <- read_csv("../data/burghardt_et_al_2015_expt1.csv")
```

You will notice the `read_csv()` function gives you a message referring to 
a "column specification". This is referring to what type of data it thinks 
each of your columns contains. 

In this case, some columns contain "character"-type data (i.e. text) and others 
contain "numeric"-type data (which can be "integer" if they have no decimal 
points, or "double" if they do).


## Look at the data

To get a glimpse of the data, we can type the name of the variable we have stored 
it in (`expt1`).

```{r head expt1}
expt1
```

This shows you the first 10 lines the data and only a few columns that fit 
on the screen.

> **Challenge:** How many rows and columns does our data set contain?

There are other ways to visually inspect your data:

- with the ``View()`` function you can have access to an interactive table, 
where you can sort, filter and search your data set with keywords (this does 
not modify your original variable):

```{r View, eval = FALSE}
View(expt1)
```

- with the ``glimpse()`` function you can get access to the structure of your data:

```{r str}
glimpse(expt1)
```

> **Challenge** what types of variables do we have in our data set? 
What could they mean?  What type of variable is "bolt"? How about "temperature"?

- ``dim()`` returns basic dimensions of your data set, i.e. numbers of rows and columns.

```{r dim}
dim(expt1)
```

- finally, for numeric variables it is convenient to use ``summary()`` function, 
which generates basic stats for each numeric column.

```{r summary}
summary(expt1)
```

So far, we have already used a handful of R functions, though we have just barely started:

- ``install.packages()``
- ``library()``
- ``read_csv()``
- ``View()``
- ``glimpse()``
- ``summary()``
- ``dim()``

Of course, it is difficult to memorize all the function names, what they are 
doing and how you should use them. 
Luckily, R has very convenient built-in help. 
To use it, type name of a function or any other object you are interested it 
preceded by `?`

```{r get help}
?summary
```

R help might seem cryptic at first, but you will get used to it, you can always 
scroll down to the 'examples' section and try running some of them yourself 
to get an idea of what the function in question is capable of.

Also, a web-search is also just as effective (if not more!) as looking at the 
help pages.

> **Challenge** what does the ``round()`` function do? 

> **Challenge** can you specifically look at the end of your data instead 
of its beginning? How would you do it in R? (hint: ``?tail``)


## Visual representation of your data

To get a "birds-eye" view at the data, to identify its structure and potential 
problems we can simply plot it in 
[Rothko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko)-style using the ``vis_dat()`` 
function.

```{r}
vis_dat(expt1)
```

> **Challenge** what is the most common data type in our data set ? 
Can you spot any potential problems?


### Missing values

You might have noticed that some of the cells are plotted in gray - these indicate 
missing values. Missing values can occur in a data set when a certain observation 
was not collected and cause potential problems in the downstream analysis if we 
are not careful. There are a couple of strategies on how to deal with missing values:

- remove rows with missing values completely (the safest option, though can result 
in substantial data loss);
- ignore missing values when you can (can you?);
- impute value based on surrounding values (the most risky).

To stay on the safe side now, we will simply remove all the rows with missing 
values from our beloved `expt1` data set.

```{r drop missing}
expt1 <- drop_na(expt1)
```

> **Challenge** How many rows are left in the data set after we have dropped 
missing values? 


## Plots! Plots! Plots!

Now that we have learned some basics of our data set, we will go straight to 
plotting to get even more insights. 

For this we will be using the `ggplot2` package, which follows a general scheme 
termed "grammar or graphics".
"Grammar of graphics" might sound scary, but just think about them as simple 
building blocks of a plot. 
By combining and layering several blocks we can create our dream plot for a 
dream paper or for a lab meeting.

To build a graph we need several blocks:

- data
- aesthetics
- geometric object (type of a plot)
- statistical transformations
- coordinate system
- positional adjustments
- faceting

Let's focus on the first three: data, aesthetics and geometric object. 

- **data** - well, this is obvious, we need some data
- **geom_objects** - actual objects that we put on a plot. A plot must have at 
least one `geom_object`. Examples include:
    - points (`geom_point` for scatter plots, dot plots)
    - lines (`geom_line` for trend lines, time series)
- **aesthetics** - things you can see and that depend on the data. For example, 
the position (x and y), colour, shape, line type, size, etc... 
Aesthetics can be set with `aes()` function. Note, different ``geom_`` 
objects can understand only a subset of aesthetics. For details, check their 
respective help (e.g. ``?geom_line``)    

You can find more imformation about how to build graphs with `ggplot2` in [this very useful document](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)

### Building a graph with ggplot2

Everyone (except Excel) likes boxplots, so we will start by plotting `days.to.flower` 
variable measured for different genotypes. 

The `ggplot()` function initialises a plot. At the very minimum it needs 
a dataset to plot:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1)
```

But this simply produces a blank (well, grey) canvas! 

We haven't told `ggplot` what _aesthetics_ (this is `ggplot2` terminology) we 
want it to map onto this blank canvas. 
For a boxplot we need to tell it what our _x_ and _y_ variables are.

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(x = genotype, y = days.to.flower))
```
 
As you can see, `ggplot` "mapped" the values in the `genotype` and `days.to.flower` 
variables of our table to the _x_ and _y_ aesthetics of the plot. 

But this is still quite an empty plot, because we haven't told `ggplot` what 
_geometries_ we want it to draw in the canvas. In our case, we want a boxplot, 
which we can add on top of the created canvas by adding (literally `+`) 
a ``geom_boxplot()``:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

> **Challenge:** can you make a violin plot instead? (hint: ``?geom_violin``)


### Adding multiple layers

Let's now layer a couple of ``geom_objects`` on the same plot. 
Say, we want to have points for the individual values together with our boxplots:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, rosette.leaf.num)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_boxplot()
```

>**Challenge:** can you modify this plot so that the points appear on top of the 
boxplots rather than behind them?


### Colours!

We can also modify the appearance of our geometry, for example it's colour:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower)) +
  geom_boxplot(colour = "red")
```

Or perhaps the colour that _fills_ the boxplots:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower)) +
  geom_boxplot(colour = "red", fill = "royalblue")
```

Or even its transparency:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower)) +
  geom_boxplot(colour = "red", fill = "royalblue", alpha = 0.5)
```

This is all very colourful, but rather gratuitous (what is this colour telling 
us about the data?!). 

What if we wanted to colour our boxplots according to which fluctuation 
treatment the plants were exposed to? In `ggplot2` language, we want to "map" 
the values of `fluctuation` onto the colour _aesthetic_ of our plot. 
This should therefore go inside the `aes()` part of our graph:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower, colour = fluctuation)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Wow! Can you see what ggplot did for you!? It automatically split the data of 
each genotype into two groups and coloured them accordingly. 

Now, let's say we wanted to visualise the individual data points (not coloured) 
behind our boxplots (coloured by fluctuation):

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower, colour = fluctuation)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5)
```

As it is, the `colour` aesthetic is mapped to _all_ geometries of the graph. This 
is because we defined it within the `ggplot()` function, which affects every 
`geom_object` that comes afterwards. 

But we can also define aesthetics inside each geometry, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = fluctuation), alpha = 0.5)
```

>**Challenge:** say we are particularly interested in the relationship between 
number of rosette leafs and blade length in mm per genotype. 
>
> Visualize this relationship with a scatter plot (`geom_point()`)
between `blade.length.mm` and `rosette.leaf.num` and colour the points by 
`genotype`. 
>
> What happens if you colour the points by `days.to.bolt`?


### Facetting

Often, our data has several grouping variables, and colours alone are not enough 
to fully represent the differences in the dataset. 

For example, the scatterplot produced in the previous exercise is pretty, but 
very crowded. What if we wanted to isolate each genotype in individual plots? 

This easy to accomplish with `ggplot2` by adding a "facet" layer to our plot. 
There are two types of facets:

- `facet_wrap()` - arranges sub-plots in a ribbon that "wraps" around 
after a fixed number of plots
- `facet_grid()` - arranges sub-plots in rows and/or columns

Let's start with `facet_wrap()` and see it in action:

```{r decomposed plot}
ggplot(expt1, aes(blade.length.mm, rosette.leaf.num, colour = genotype)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap( ~ genotype)
```

>**Challenge:** In the previous graph, colouring the genotype is redundant with 
the facetting. Can you think of a more useful way to colour the points?

Now let's see how the same code works with `facet_grid()`:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(blade.length.mm, rosette.leaf.num, colour = genotype)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(. ~ genotype)
```

In this case, our facets are arranged in individual columns. We can arrange them 
in rows like so:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(blade.length.mm, rosette.leaf.num, colour = genotype)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(genotype ~ .)
```

>**Challenge:** Can you modify the previous graph to facet the data by the 
`fluctuation` treatment (as rows) and `day.length` (as columns) and colour the 
points by genotype.

In conclusion, **by effectively combining facets, colours and other aesthetics 
you can represent many dimensions of your data in a single graph!**

-----

>**Challenge**: Can you produce a graph similar to 
![Fig. 2B-C of Burghard et al 2015](../materials/Burghard_fig2BC.png). 
>
>**Hint**: facet the plot by `day.length` and `temperature` and fill the boxplots by `fluctuation`.


### Interactivity!

But even this is not the limit. We can easily turn our plots into 
interactive ones using the `plotly` package. 

First we store our plot in a variable and then pass it to the special `ggplotly()`
function.


```{r go interactive}
# Store plot in a variable called p1
p1 <- ggplot(expt1, aes(blade.length.mm, rosette.leaf.num, colour = fluctuation)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~genotype)

# Render an interactive plot using ggplotly function
ggplotly(p1)
```


## Themes

Every element of a ggplot is modifiable. This is out of the scope for this 
module, but here's a few examples and references.

Themes modify the overall appearance of the plot. Some come with `ggplot2` and 
many others can be obtained from other packages such as
[`ggthemes`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html) 
(which also has some additional geom objects).

```{r}
# Example of built-in ggplot2 themes
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Black and white theme")

ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Classic theme")

ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Minimal theme")
```


The `theme()` function is used to modify individual elements of the plot. 
The possibilities are so vast that the easiest way is to do a web-search for 
your intended purpose. 

For example, a web-search for "vertical labels x axis ggplot2" returns as one of 
the first hits [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1330989/rotating-and-spacing-axis-labels-in-ggplot2): 

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

Or searching for "altering plot colours ggplot2" returns 
[this page](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-colors-how-to-change-colors-automatically-and-manually), 
which somewhere gives an interesting solution:

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower, fill = fluctuation)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

## Homework

Based on the principles outlined in this module, try and build a graph of your own dataset using `ggplot2`.

If you encounter any difficulties, we will discuss them in the next module!

## Extras

Some other packages that add functionality to `ggplot2`:

- [`gridExtra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/arrangeGrob.html) 
to combine several plots together
- [`ggthemes`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html) 
to add extra themes and geometries
- [`ggridges`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html) 
to produce "ridge" plots (also known as "joyplots")
- [`GGally`](https://ggobi.github.io/ggally/) for automatically plotting 
relationships between data
