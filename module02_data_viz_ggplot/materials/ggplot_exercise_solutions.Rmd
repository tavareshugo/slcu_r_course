## Data Visualization with R - exercise solutions

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
expt1 <- read_csv("../data/burghardt_et_al_2015_expt1.csv")
```


> **Challenge:** can you make a violin plot instead? (hint: ``?geom_violin``)

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.flower)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

-----------------------

>**Challenge:** can you modify this plot so that the points appear on top of the 
boxplots rather than behind them?

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, rosette.leaf.num)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_jitter()
```

----------------------

>**Challenge:** say we are particularly interested in the relationship between 
number of rosette leafs and blade length in mm per genotype. 
>
> Visualize this relationship with a scatter plot (`geom_point()`)
between `blade.length.mm` and `rosette.leaf.num` and colour the points by 
`genotype`. 
>
> What happens if you colour the points by `days.to.bolt`?


```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(blade.length.mm, rosette.leaf.num, colour = genotype)) +
  geom_point()
```

If we colour the points by `days.to.bolt` the colour scale is continuous 
rather than discrete (because `days.to.bolt` is a numeric variable):

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(blade.length.mm, rosette.leaf.num, colour = days.to.bolt)) +
  geom_point()
```


---------------------

>**Challenge:** In the previous graph, colouring the genotype is redundant with 
the facetting. Can you think of a more useful way to colour the points?

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(blade.length.mm, rosette.leaf.num, colour = fluctuation)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap( ~ genotype)
```


------------------------

>**Challenge:** Can you modify the previous graph to facet the data by the 
`fluctuation` treatment (as rows) and `day.length` (as columns) and colour the 
points by genotype.

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(blade.length.mm, rosette.leaf.num, colour = genotype)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(day.length ~ fluctuation)
```


------------------------

>**Challenge**: Can you produce a graph similar to 
![Fig. 2B-C of Burghard et al 2015](../materials/Burghard_fig2BC.png). 
>
>**Hint**: facet the plot by `day.length` and `temperature` and fill the boxplots by `fluctuation`.

```{r}
ggplot(expt1, aes(genotype, days.to.bolt, fill = fluctuation)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_grid(day.length ~ temperature)
```
